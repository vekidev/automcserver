# About

This is automcserver, which helps you download and setup a Minecraft[1] server automatically. It downloads the newest Minecraft server and (optionally) can setup ngrok[2] or localtonet[2] tunnel services so that you don't have to do anything.

# Setup

In order to run the script, you can use the jsdelivr link to get the latest version. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine AND you run this script in an EMPTY folder.

`
python -c "$(curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vekidev/automcserver/gen.py)"
